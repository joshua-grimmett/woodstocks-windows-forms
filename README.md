# Woodstocks Stock Control Application 2019

The goal was to implement the designed stock control editor program for the toy shop, WoodStocks to migrate from manual paper counts to digital. The program was designed to suit the needs of the client on Windows and the program was built on the .NET framework, Windows Forms. Unit testing was used throughout the development of the program to ensure the needs of the client were met and was documented in the development manual.

The project was implemented successfully according to an agile development process. The first iteration implemented loading the stocks from CSV, a table view including stock counts, editing of stock counts and then saving back to a CSV file.

In the second iteration, reading from XML was implemented according to the needs of the client and included a list view of stocks as well as the previously implemented table view. Stylesheets were also included as documented in the user and development manual.

User and development manuals are available.
